      <title>Go Microservice with Clean Architecture: Coding Style</title>

      <description>Coding style is a relatively boring topic in programming, but it is crucial to have an appropriate coding style to be an effective programmer. There are three components in it:
 Application layout and folder structure
 Coding rules or style
 Naming convention
  I already talked about application layout in “Go Microservice with Clean Architecture: Application Layout”¹ , so this article covers the rest.
Coding rules or style  No package level variables.</description>

      <title>Go Microservice with Clean Architecture: Transaction Support</title>

      <description>In order to support the transaction in the business layer, I tried to get a Spring like declarative transaction management in Go, but couldn’t find it, so I decided to write one. Transaction is easy to implement in Go, but it is pretty difficult to get it right.
Requirement:  Separate business logic from transaction code. One should only think about business logic when writing a use case, no need to be aware of transaction management.</description>

      <description>I created a Microservice with Go and gRPC and tried to apply best practice of application design and programming to this project. I wrote a series of articles about decisions and trade-offs I made when working on the project. This one is about application design.
The design of the application followed Clean Architecture¹. There are three layers in business logic code: use case, domain model and data service.
There are three top level packages “usecase”, “model” and “dataservice”, and one for each layer.</description>

      <description>Inspiration of design: I wrote a Go Microservice application recently and the design of this application coming from three inspirations:
 Clean Architecture¹ and SOLID² design principle³
 Spring’s application context⁴
 Go’s concise design⁵ especially Go’s implementation of object-oriented design⁶
  I used Spring’s interface-based programming and Dependency Injection to implement Bob Martin’s Clean Architecture with Go’s simplicity idiom. Trade-offs have been made when there are conflicts among them.</description>

      <description>I created a Microservice with Go and gRPC and tried to figure out what is the best project layout, which can be used as a template for my future projects. I came from Java background and found myself keeping struggling between Java and Go idioms, which are quite different. I wrote a series of articles about decisions and trade-offs I made when working on the project. This is the first one, which is about project structure.</description>

      <guid>https://jfeng45.github.io/project/go-microservice-template/</guid>
      <description>A project to show the application layout for a Microservice application in gRPC and Go. It applied Clean Architecture design and used dependency injection to inject concrete types into each function.</description>

      <description>A project to learn writing Microservice in GRPC and Go, and it is not intended for production use. I originally took the code form Alan Shreve&amp;rsquo;s gRPC cache service and made some changes on retry and timeout features.</description>
