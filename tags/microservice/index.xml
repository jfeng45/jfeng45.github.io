      <description>I created a Microservice project with Go and gRPC and tried to figure out what is the best project layout, which can be used as a template for my future projects. I also tried to apply the best practice in application design and programming, such as Clean Architecture, Dependency Injection, logging, error handling and so on, to the Go Microservice application. I came from Java background and found myself keeping struggling between Java and Go idioms, which are quite different.</description>
